                <div class="about">This quiz has been created in order to educate newcommers to the hobby of FPV and
                    quad copters.
                    Whilst FPV is a fun and rewarding hobby, it has a notoriously steep learning curve. There is a lot
                    to learn about a wide variety of topics and you must be familiar with them all in order to be a safe
                    and competenet pilot. There are many laws in the UK that restrict flight and it is imperative that
                    you are as familiar with the law as you are with your kit. This quiz aims to highlight some of the
                    key areas of knowledge to focus on and help beginners identify their weaknesses.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="about">The knowledge required to answer the questions within the quiz can be gained from the
                    resouces page,
                    found in the navigation bar, as well as through other online resources. Flying RC FPV quad copters
                    requires patience, skill and often a lot of research and tinkering in order to get this working the
                    way that they should.</div>

                    of the hobby.</div>
